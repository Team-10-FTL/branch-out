                    We aim to help university students confidently dive into open source by surfacing projects that are active, clear, and aligned with their goals. Ultimately, early developers are able to truly "commit to what matters".

                    Open source is powerful â€” but hard to break into. As students, we were overwhelmed trying to find projects that made sense, felt welcoming, or matched what we were learning.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So we built the platform we wish we had: A space that makes discovering and contributing to open source simple, relevant, and beginner-friendly.
